# Fish

A procedurally animated fish simulation using JavaScript and p5.js. This project features smooth, lifelike fish animations that swim across the screen.

## Overview

This project is a heavily modified JavaScript/p5.js port of the original [animal-proc-anim](https://github.com/argonautcode/animal-proc-anim) project. It brings procedurally animated fish to the browser, showcasing fluid swimming motions and dynamic movement patterns.

## Installation & Usage

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LeBogoo/fish.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the project using a local web server like Python's built-in HTTP server or Live Server in Visual Studio Code.
   ```sh
   cd fish
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Online Demo

## Dependencies

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - A JavaScript library for creative coding.

## Customization

Modify `fish.js` to tweak fish behavior, appearance, or swimming patterns. You can experiment with different parameters like the speed and other properties to create unique fish behaviors.
